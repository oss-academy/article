MVC is a software design pattern in order to apply in architecture level and frontend level. It is included three 
component named, Model, View and Controller. So that, users can interact with the Controller and send data to Model 
component with getting help from View, then View will get the updates from model directly. The MVC uses for Desktop and
Web application.

## Model
It is a backend component included data, logic and rules for the data. Indeed, Model is a data model include some fields
with their specifications.
