# <p align="center">MVC</p>

MVC is a software architectural pattern. It is included three component named, Model, View and Controller. So that, 
users can interact with the Controller and send data to Model component with getting help from View, then View will get 
the updates from model directly. The MVC uses for Desktop and Web application.

### Model
It is a backend component included data, logic and rules of the data. Indeed, Model is a data model to represent the
knowledge.

### View
This part is a frontend component and, it is responsible to present the data and get input data from end user. Sometimes
View is named as a UI component.

### Controller
It is a component to make a relation between Model and View so that it is named the brain of application. The Controller
receive data and command from user with getting help from View, then makes a command for Model.
